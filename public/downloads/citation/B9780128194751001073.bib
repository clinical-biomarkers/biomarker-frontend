abstract = {Roadmaps developed for glycoscience in the past decade have foreseen the growing need for centralized databases and associated software to match progress in high throughput technology. This chapter describes the partnership of three glycoinformatics platforms in developing open access resources that facilitate data sharing and information exchange. This joint effort called the GlySpace Alliance is geared toward providing high quality, reliable, well-referenced, and accurate data. Each partner's present contribution is described and put into perspective with regard to the globally shared mission of enhancing access to data in the glycoscience sphere.}
